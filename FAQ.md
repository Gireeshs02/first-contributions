### 1. What is “First Contributions”?
This is a simple repo meant to help people make their first open-source contribution. It walks you through forking, branching, making changes, and submitting a PR (pull request).

---

### 2. I’ve never used Git/GitHub before — where do I begin?
Start by reading the [README](README.md) fully. If needed, you can refer to external tutorials (GitHub Docs, etc.) for basics like git clone, git branch, commit, push. Then follow the step-by-step guide in this repo. If something isn’t clear, you can ask in Discussions → Questions & Help.

---

### 3. What should I do if I make a mistake (e.g. wrong branch, wrong commit)?
Mistakes happen! You can: 1) correct them before opening a PR; 2) if after PR, push new commits to the branch; 3) if entirely wrong, close the PR and open a fresh one; or ask for help in Discussions. We can guide.

---

### 4. How do I name my branch / commit message?
Use a descriptive and consistent naming: for example ```add-<your-username>``` for the branch, and commit messages like ```Add <YourName> to Contributors list```. Helps maintainability. (You can also add your tech stack info etc.).

---

### 5. Do I have to use a specific code editor / IDE?
No — any editor will work. The repo only requires simple text changes. If you want, you can use tools like VS Code, Atom, or even GitHub’s web editor.

---

### 6. How do I test locally / check that everything is okay before PR?
For this repo, since it’s mostly about adding names to a file, testing is minimal. Just verify that your name shows correctly in Contributors.md, links are correct, formatting consistent (e.g. same bullet style), no syntax errors. If there's any formatting style (spacing, line breaks), follow existing pattern.

---

### 7. What happens after I create a PR?
Maintainers will review it. If everything looks good (no conflicts, formatting fine), they’ll merge it. If something needs adjusting (naming, formatting, etc.), they’ll leave comments and ask you to make changes.
- Always check for open PRs that might conflict with yours. If unsure, ask in Discussions before submitting.

---

### 8. Can I contribute something other than adding my name?
Yes! Once you're comfortable, you could suggest improvements: fixing typos in README, improving instructions, adding more examples, adding more tech stacks, making UI improvements, etc. You can propose ideas in Discussions → Ideas.

---

### 9. Where to get help if I get stuck?
Use the Discussions tab (especially Questions & Help) to ask. You can also look up GitHub Docs, StackOverflow, or peer-projects. But feel free to post here; community is welcoming.

---

### 10. Is there a Code of Conduct?
Yes! Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help keep the community friendly, welcoming, and safe for everyone.

---

### 11. What can I do after my first contribution?
Once your first PR is merged, you can explore adding improvements to README, adding examples, contributing to new issues, or learning Git/GitHub basics more deeply. Discussions → Ideas is a great place to start.
